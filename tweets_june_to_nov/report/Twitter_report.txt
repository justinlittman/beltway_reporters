   Research Notes 

      Paths in re-tweet networks tend to be small and hierarchical which makes many 
      traditional social network measures empirically uninteresting. 
      Closeness is not calculated for twitter data because: a) most nodes are not 
      reachable, and b) it is expensive to calculate given the size of the data. 
      Traditional betweenness is not calculated because: a) given the length of 
      chains, most nodes have only a small value and it does not discriminate among 
      nodes, and b) it is expensive to calculate given the size of the data. 
      Eigenvector centrality is not calculated because: a) there are rarely cases of 
      mutual retweeting and so dense interconnected networks that would lead to high 
      values, and b) it is expensive to calculate given the size of the data.
